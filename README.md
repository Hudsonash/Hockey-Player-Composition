# Hockey-Player-Composition
Sorting NHL players into player types into player types and determining if a team's composition of player types translates into regular season success.

The players are sorted into 6 categories:
* Sniper: High scoring players
* Playmakers: Set-up players
* Grinders: Players that do a bit of everything
* Defensive: Players who excel on the PK
* Enforcer: Players who get in many fights
* Power: A mix of scoring prowess and penalties

The players are sorted each year and have scores created based on their number of standard deviations away from the year's average.  The scores are then used to determine if a player falls under a specific category

In addition, the correlation of a team's points it earns in the regular season and it's composition of a player type is tested to see if there is any link between a team's success and the player type ratio.
